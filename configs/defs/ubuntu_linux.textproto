    title: "Ensure actions as another user are always logged"
    description:
      "sudo provides users with temporary elevated privileges to perform operations, either as "
      "the superuser or another user. "
    rationale:
      "Creating an audit log of users with temporary elevated privileges and the operation(s) they "
      "performed is essential to reporting. Administrators will want to correlate the events "
      "written to the audit trail with the records written to sudo's logfile to verify if unauthorized "
      "commands have been executed."
    remediation:
      "Create audit rules\n"
      "Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending in .rules extension, with "
      "the relevant rules to monitor elevated privileges.\n"
      "64 Bit systems\n"
      "Example:\n"
      "```\n"
      "# printf \"\n"
      "-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k "
      "user_emulation\n"
      "-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k "
      "user_emulation\n"
      "\" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-user_emulation.rules\n"
      "```\n"
      "Load audit rules\n"
      "Merge and load the rules into active configuration:\n"
      "```\n"
      "# augenrules --load\n"
      "```\n"
      "Check if reboot is required.\n"
      "```\n"
      "# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep \"enabled\") =~ \"2\" ]]; then printf \"Reboot "
      "required to load rules\\\\n\"; fi\n"
      "```\n"
      "32 Bit systems\n"
      "Follow the same procedures as for 64 bit systems and ignore any entries with b64."

    title: "Ensure Apport Error Reporting Service is disabled"
    description: 
      "The Apport Error Reporting Service automatically generates crash reports for debugging. Disabling this service prevents collection of potentially sensitive data such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files."
    rationale: 
      "Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other private material. Disabling it reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information."
    remediation: 
      "To disable Apport Error Reporting, follow these steps:\n"
      "1. Edit `/etc/default/apport` and set the `enabled` parameter to `0`:\n"
      "```"
      "enabled=0\n"
      "```"
      "2. Run the following commands to stop and mask the Apport service:\n"
      "```"
      "# systemctl stop apport.service\n"
      "# systemctl mask apport.service\n"
      "```"
      "3. Alternatively, remove the apport package entirely:\n"
      "```"
      "# apt purge apport\n"
      "```"
      "Ensure all steps are in compliance with organizational policies."
