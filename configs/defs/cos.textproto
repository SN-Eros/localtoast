    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description:
      "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary "
      "storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale:
      "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the "
      "noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to "
      "install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from "
      "establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to "
      "be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be "
      "broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If "
      "the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker "
      "could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished "
      "by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition "
      "for /tmp."
    remediation:
      "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.\n"
      "example:\n"
      "```\n"
      "tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0\n"
      "```\n"
      "OR\n"
      "Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:\n"
      "```\n"
      "systemctl unmask tmp.mount\n"
      "systemctl enable tmp.mount\n"
      "```\n"
      "Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount to configure "
      "the /tmp mount:\n"
      "```\n"

    title: "Ensure core dumps are restricted"
    description:
      "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally "
      "used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean "
      "confidential information from a core file. The system provides the "
      "ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden "
      "by the user."
    rationale:
      "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the "
      "soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for "
      "user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the "
      "fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from "
      "dumping core."
    remediation:
      "Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a "
      "/etc/security/limits.d/* file\n:"
      "* hard core 0\n"
      "Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:\n"
      "```\n"
      "# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0\n"
      "```\n"
      "If systemd-coredump@ is installed:\n"
      "edit /etc/systemd/coredump.conf and add/modify the following lines:\n"

      "On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available "

    title: "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted"
    description:
      "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify\n"
      "the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed\n"
      "packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases,\n"
      "systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private\n"
      "addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to\n"
      "be used."
    rationale:
      "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, and \n"
      "net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from \n"
      "accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing \n"

      "the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing \n"
      "circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use \n"
      "the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source \n"
      "routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private \n"

    description:
      "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the "

      "ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are "
      "terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will "
      "send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When "
      "the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no "
      "response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, "
      "if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the "
      "ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be "
      "terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale:
      "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an "
      "unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user "
      "walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting "
      "a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.\n"
      "While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this "
      "timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for "
      "ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be "

    title: "Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less"
    description:
      "The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator "
      "to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is "

    rationale:
      "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised "
      "credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online "
      "brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, "
      "reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's "
      "window of opportunity."
