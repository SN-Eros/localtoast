      "usrquota/grpquota may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each"

    description:

      "Configuring /var/log/audit as its own file system allows an administrator to set"
      "additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an"

      "filesystem-specific options."

      "separate partition for /var/log/audit."

    title: "Ensure ptrace_scope is restricted"
    description:
      "The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process (the \"tracer\") may"
      "observe and control the execution of another process (the \"tracee\"), and examine and"
      "change the tracee's memory and registers."
      "The sysctl settings (writable only with CAP_SYS_PTRACE) are:"
      "• 0 - classic ptrace permissions: a process can PTRACE_ATTACH to any other"
      "process running under the same uid, as long as it is dumpable (i.e. did not"
      "transition uids, start privileged, or have called prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE...)"
      "already). Similarly, PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged."
      "• 1 - restricted ptrace: a process must have a predefined relationship with the"
      "inferior it wants to call PTRACE_ATTACH on. By default, this relationship is that"
      "of only its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met. To change"
      "the relationship, an inferior can call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, debugger, ...) to"
      "declare an allowed debugger PID to call PTRACE_ATTACH on the inferior."
      "Using PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged."
      "• 2 - admin-only attach: only processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE may use ptrace"
      "with PTRACE_ATTACH, or through children calling PTRACE_TRACEME."
      "• 3 - no attach: no processes may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH nor via"
      "PTRACE_TRACEME. Once set, this sysctl value cannot be changed."
    rationale:
      "If one application is compromised, it would be possible for an attacker to attach to other"
      "running processes (e.g. Bash, Firefox, SSH sessions, GPG agent, etc) to extract	  "
      "additional credentials and continue to expand the scope of their attack."
      "Enabling restricted mode will limit the ability of a compromised process to"
      "PTRACE_ATTACH on other processes running under the same user. With restricted"
      "mode, ptrace will continue to work with root user."

    description:
      "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally "

    rationale:
      "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the "
      "soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for "
      "user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the "

    description:
      "• server"
      "o The server directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time"
      "source. The client-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client might"
      "synchronize its system time to that of the server, but the server’s system"
      "time will never be influenced by that of a client."
      "o This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple servers."
      "o The directive is immediately followed by either the name of the server, or"
      "its IP address."
      "• pool"
      "o The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the server directive, except"
      "that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than a single NTP"
      "server. The pool name is expected to resolve to multiple addresses which"
      "might change over time."
      "o This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple pools."
      "o All options valid in the server directive can be used in this directive too."
